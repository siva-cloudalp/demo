/**
 * The base class for all PageType views. Views that render a registered page type must extend this class. In particular, the `PageTypeBaseView` class exposes the `beforeShowContent` method to delay rendering of the view. By overriding this method, you can do additional work before the view is rendered, such as retrieving data for the view. 
 * 
 * *Note:* The `registerPageType()` method of the {@link PageType} component accepts an object as its argument. Use a PageTypeBaseView view as a value of the `view` property of the object.

     * 
     * This method is called after the `initialize()` method.
     *

     *          // data for the view with a jQuery HTTP GET request. 
     *          $.get('https://example.com/data/get/1234').then(function(data) {
     *              if (data) {
