/**
 * SCCollection is the SuiteCommerce implementation of Backbone.Collection. It extends Backbone.Collection and inherits all methods and properties. See the {@link https://backbonejs.org/|Backbone.js} website for complete documentation.
 * 
 * **In extensions on SuiteCommerce 2020.1 and later, use SCCollection instead of Backbone.Collection.**
 * 
 * The following example shows how you might extend SCCollection to create a basic child class object called 'MyCollection'. Note that SCCollection expects a model, so when calling the parent class with `call()`, we pass a model instance to SCCollection with `models`.
 * 
 *  _MyCollection.Collection.js_
 * ```javascript
 * 			define(
 * 	'MyCollection',
 * 	['SCCollection', 'MyModel'],
 * 	function('SCCollectionComponent, MyModel') {
 * 		var SCCollection = SCCollectionComponent.SCCollection;
 * 
 * 		function MyCollection(models, options) {
 * 			SCCollection.call(this, models, options);
 * 
 * 			this.model = MyModel;
 * 			this.url = function() {return 'services/MyCollection.ss'};
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		// Inherit parent instance methods.
 * 		MyCollection.prototype = Object.create(SCCollection.prototype);
 * 
 * 		MyCollection.prototype.constructor = MyCollection;
 * 
 * 		// Add instance methods here...
 * 
 * 		// Return the AMD constructor
 * 		return MyCollection;
 * 	}
 * );
 * ```
 * 
 * @hideconstructor
