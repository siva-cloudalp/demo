/**
 * The Layout component class lets you manage views in the application, as well as the content of those views. Use this component to add or remove child views, bind DOM event handlers, and set context data in the view. Other components, such as {@link Cart} and {@link PDP}, let you manage specific parts of the application. Use the Layout component when you need to work with visual aspects of the application that are not covered by one of the specific components. For example, you can use Layout to modify the header or footer areas on a page. 
 * 
 * Working with the Layout component also typically requires working with properties and methods of the {@link View} class. You will also need to reference data attributes in the templates (usually the HTML data attributes called 'data-view' and 'data-cms-area'). For example, inserting a child view requires you to specify the value of the 'data-view' attribute of the HTML element in which you want to add the child view.
 * 
 * Get an instance of this component by calling `container.getComponent('Layout')`;
 * 
 * Note: Other visual components in the API, such as {@link Cart} and {@link PDP} extend Layout and its methods, except for the 'showContent' method, which is only avilable in Layout.

	/**
	 * Adds a child view to a view that already exists in the DOM. Child views can be added to elements that have the `data-view` or `data-cms-area` data attribute. If there are multiple elements in a template that have a data-view attribute value of `view_id`, the child view is added to all elements with that ID. Elements with the data-view attribute act as placeholders in the application. If there is content in the view (which is typically the case), the child view replaces the current content. 
	 * 
	 *  If you want to add multiple views at the same time, or if you want to add a child view while preserving the current content in the existing view, use {@link Layout#addChildViews|addChildViews}.
	 * 
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			layout.addChildView('Header.View', function () {
	 *   return new HolidayBannerView({});
	 * });
	 * ```
	 * In the above example, the view `HolidayBannerView` will be added as a child view of an element in any template that has a data-view attribute of `Header.View`. 
	 * 
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			layout.addChildView('cms:header_banner_top', function () {
	 *   return new HolidayBannerView({});
	 * });
	 * ```
	 * In the above example, a child view is added to a predefined SMT area called 'header_banner_top'. In the template, the header_banner_top SMT area might be in a div tag in the following way: `<div data-cms-area="header_banner_top"></div>`. Because header_banner_top is a predefined SMT area, the `cms:` prefix is used before the `view_id` argument.
	 * 
	 * @param {String} data_view The view to which the child view will be added. `data_view` is the value of the 'data-view' or 'data-cms-area' data attributes of an element on the page. For example, the header logo view uses the following data-view data attribute: `<div data-view="Header.Logo">`.
	 * @param {SimpleChildViewConstructor} view_constructor An instance of a view. Use a constructor function to get an instance of a view.
	 * @return {Void} Returns null if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it throws an exception.
	 * @throws {Error}

	/**
	 * Adds one or more child views to a view that already exists in the DOM. Child views can be added to elements that have the `data-view` or `data-cms-area` data attribute. If there are multiple elements in a template that have a data-view (or data-cms-area) attribute value of `view_id`, the child views are added to all elements with that ID. 
	 * 
	 * As opposed to the {addChildView} method, the current content in the data attribute element is not replaced by the child views. Instead, the child view is appended after the content in the data attribute element. If you want to add just one single child view while keeping the current content, use this method instead of {addChildView}. 
	 * 
	 * You can also specify the order in which the child views are rendered in the view by setting the `childViewIndex` property of the child view object. This index is 10-based. Set a value less than 10 to prepend the child view to the current content; set a value greater than 10 to append the child view to the current content. If adding multiple child views, set a different index in each child view object.  
	 *
	 * The addChildViews method is flexible, but more complex than `addChildView`. Use the simpler {@link Layout#addChildView|addChildView} where possible. 
	 *
	 * In the following example, `addChildViews` is used to add two child views to the `checkout.WIZARD_VIEW` main view. The child views will be added to the placeholder element that has a data-view attribute with the value `Wizard.StepNavigation`. `Wizard.StepNavigation` has an object as its value, which holds the child views to be added to the placeholder. Each child view is specified as a separate property/value pair, with the property as the view name and the value as an object that returns the child view. Within the object that returns the child view, you set the index of the child view and a child view construtor function.
	 * 
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			checkout.addChildViews(
	 *   checkout.WIZARD_VIEW,
	 *   {
	 *     'Wizard.StepNavigation': 
	 *     {
	 *       'FirstCheckoutView': 
	 *       {
	 *         childViewIndex: 1,

	 *       'SecondCheckoutView': 
	 *       {
	 *         childViewIndex: 2,
	 *         childViewConstructor: function() 
	 *         {
	 *           return new SecondCheckoutExtensionView({checkout:checkout})
	 *         }
	 *       }
	 *     }
	 *   }
	 * );

	 * 
	 * @param {String} view_id The identifier (ID) of the main view to which the child views will be added. 
	 * @param {Object} child_views An object containing a set of nested properties and objects that determine the placeholder to which the child views will be added, as well as the child views themselves.
	 * @return {void} Returns null if the operation is successful. Otherwise, it throws an exception.

	/**
	 * Adds a property to the context data of a view. The property can then be referenced in templates. If the property already exists in the context data of the view, it is updated. For example, if a view has a property called 'thumbnail' and you pass 'thumbnail' in the `property_name` argument, then the return value of the callback function overwrites the current value of 'thumbnail'.
	 * 
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			var layout = container.getComponent('Layout');

	 * });

	 * In the above example, the first and second arguments indicate the view, 'Header.View', to which the property, '48HourShippingMessage', will be added. The function returns a message as a string, with the first name of the logged in user and the message text. To display the message in the view, add the property to the template with the expression `{{48HourShippingMessage}}`.

	 * * `options` - An object with a single property `className` to indicate the Sass class name that will be applied to the modal. The class name is applied to the modal itself, not the modal content.
