	/**
	 * Registers a tracker in the application. A tracker enables you to listen for one or more events in the application - such as navigation, page views, and transactions - and then do something in response to those events. Trackers are especially useful if you want to integrate with third-party services that track user activity or behavior in a web store.
	 * 
	 * **Note**: If you want to track other events in the application, you can create custom events and trigger those events with {@link Environment#triggerEvent|triggerEvent()}.
	 * 
	 * In an extension, you can use any of the following predefined listener functions to listen for application events:
	 * * trackAddToCart - Called when a line is added to the cart, or the quantity of an item changes.
	 * * trackCartUpdate - Called when a line is added to the cart.
	 * * trackPageview - Called when a page is viewed.
	 * * trackProductView - Called when a product details page (PDP) is viewed.
	 * * trackTransaction - Called when a transaction is completed.
	 * 
	 * To register a tracker in the application, create an object with one (or several) of the predefined listener functions as an object method. Add whatever logic you require in the method - all the listener functions provide event data which you can utilise in your logic. Then call the `addTracker()` method to register the tracker.  
	 * 
	 * In the following example, the tracker object `myTracker` defines a `trackAddToCart` function, which will be called when an item is added to the cart. In the function, we call the `logShoppingEvent()` method of the `_exampleTrackingService` object, which belongs to a (fictitious) third party service. In the `logShoppingEvent()` method, we pass in a tracking identifier or trigger (in this case, `addToCart`), and some item information from the event data. To register the tracker in our extension, we call `addTracker()` with `myTracker` as the argument. Now, whenever a user adds an item to the cart, it is tracked in the third-party service.
	 * 
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			var environment = container.getComponent("Environment");
	 * 
	 * var myTracker = {
	 * 	trackAddToCart: function(line) {
	 * 		_exampleTrackingService.logShoppingEvent(
	 * 			'addToCart',
	 * 			{
	 * 				name: line.item.displayname,
	 * 				sku: line.item.itemid,
	 * 				amount: line.amount,
	 * 				quantity: line.quantity
	 * 			}
	 * 		);
	 * 	}
	 * }
	 * 
	 * environment.addTracker(tracker);
	 * ```
	 * 
	 * **Note**: Third-party website services and agents work have different requirements and methods of implementation.

	/**
	 * Triggers a custom event defined in a Tracker object. Data can be appended to the custom event by passing in an object with as many property/value pairs as required.
	 * 
	 * **Note**: `triggerEvent` cannot be used to trigger any of the standard application events, for example, when an item is added to the cart or the product details page is viewed. Instead, you should use {@link Environment#addTracker|addTracker()} to work with those events. 
	 * 
	 * <p style="color: #80a9d7; margin-bottom: 3px"><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong></p>
	 * 
	 * The following example shows basic usage of the `triggerEvent()` method. `myTracker` is an object with two listener functions. `trackAddToCart` is an application listener function that is called natively by the application when an item is added to the cart. `trackCreateReview` is a custom event listener function that we want to call when a user clicks a button to create a review. To trigger the custom event, you use `triggerEvent()`. 
	 * After the tracker object is defined, register it in the application with {@link Environment#addTracker|addTracker()}. Then you can define some data for the custom event in `myEventData` and call `triggerEvent()` to trigger the custom event.
	 * 
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			var environment = container.getComponent('Environment');
	 * 
	 * var myTracker = {
	 *	trackAddToCart: function(line) {
	 *	 	var itemName = line.name;
	 *		// Do something.
	 *		// ...
	 *	},
	 *	trackCreateReview: function() {
	 *		// Do something with custom event.
	 *		// ...
	 *	}
	 * }
	 * 
	 * environment.addTracker(myTracker);
	 * 
	 * var myEventData = {timestamp: Date.now()};
	 * 
	 * environment.triggerEvent('trackCreateReview', myEventData);
	 * ```
	 * &nbsp;
	 * 
	 * <p style="color: #80a9d7;margin-bottom: 3px;"><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong></p>
	 * 
	 * The following example shows how you might use `triggerEvent()` to track when a user compares items on the website. This example is divided between two files: _Company.CompareProductsExtension.MainModule.js_, which corresponds to the main module file; and _MainModule.View.js_, which is a view file. 
	 * 
	 * **Note**: The examples use a fictitious third-party tracking service called `_externalService`. Usage of a third-party provider or service for tracking purposes requires separate steps to set up and implement. 
	 * 
	 * In the main module file, in the `mountToApp()` function, you instantiate the Environment component and create an object in which you declare a custom event listener function called `compareProductsDone`. Inside the function, the underscore function `_.map` is used to create an array of item names and skus. You then call the appropriate method of the external service (represented here with `_externalService`) in which you want to track the action, in this case `logCommerceEvent()`. 
	 * 
	 *  _Company.CompareProductsExtension.MainModule.js_
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			// ...
	 * mountToApp: function mountToApp(container) {
	 * 
	 * 	var environment = container.getComponent('Environment');
	 * 
	 * 	var myTracker = {
	 *		compareProductsDone: function(data) {
	 *			var products = _.map(data.items, function(item) {
	 *	 			return {
	 *	 				name: item.name,
	 *					sku: item.sku
	 *				}
	 *			});
	 *			_externalService.logCommerceEvent('productscompare', {products.products});
	 *		}
	 * 	}
	 * 
	 * 	environment.addTracker(myTracker);
	 * }
	 * // ...
	 * ```
	 * <!--
	 * THIS EXAMPLE USES A NATIVE BACKBONE VIEW, WHICH IS NO LONGER RECOMMENDED IN EXTENSIONS.
	 * 
	 * In the view file, use the `events` hash to bind the `click` event on a HTML element to the method that will do the comparison, `onCompareProductsAction()`. In the `onCompareProductsAction()` method, `triggerEvent()` is called with the custom event lister function as the first argument, and a list of the items for comparison as the second argument.
	 * `this.compareItems` is an ancilliary function that redirects to a comparison page. In this case, it expects a list of internal IDs of the items for comparison, which we can get with the {@link https://underscorejs.org/#pluck|_.pluck()} function.
	 * 
	 *  _MainModule.View.js_
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			// ...
	 * events = {
	 * 	'click [data-action="compare-products"]': 'onCompareProductsAction'
	 * }
	 * 
	 * onCompareProductsAction: function onCompareProductsAction() {
	 * 	this.environment.triggerEvent('compareProductsDone', { items: this.itemsAddedToTheComparison });
	 * 	this.compareItems(_.pluck(this.itemsAddedToTheComparison, 'internalid'));
	 * }
	 * 
	 * // ...
	 * ```
	 * -->
	 * In the view file (based on the {@link SCView} component), define a {@link SCView#getEvents|getEvents()} function to bind the `click` event on a HTML element to the method that will do the comparison, `onCompareProductsAction()`. In the `onCompareProductsAction()` method, `triggerEvent()` is called with the custom event listener function as the first argument, and a list of the items for comparison as the second argument.
	 * `this.compareItems` is an ancilliary function that redirects to a comparison page. In this case, it expects a list of internal IDs of the items for comparison, which we can get with the {@link https://underscorejs.org/#pluck|_.pluck()} function.
	 * 
	 *  _MainModule.View.js_
	 * ```javascript
	 * 			// ...
	 * MainView.prototype.getEvents = function() {
	 * 	return {
	 * 		'click [data-action="compare-products"]': 'onCompareProductsAction'
	 * 	}
	 * }
	 * 
	 * // Function called by the click event on the element with the data attribute 'compare-products'.
	 * MainView.prototype.onCompareProductsAction = function() {
	 * 	this.environment.triggerEvent('compareProductsDone', { items: this.itemsAddedToTheComparison });
	 * 	this.compareItems(_.pluck(this.itemsAddedToTheComparison, 'internalid'));
	 * }
	 * 
	 * MainView.prototype.compareItems = function(items) {
	 * 	// Compare the items.
	 * }
	 * // ...
	 * ```
