/**
 * SCView is the SuiteCommerce implementation of {@link https://backbonejs.org/#View|Backbone.View}. It provides an abstract class called `SCView`. You must extend SCView by creating a child class object that inherits from it. You can then instantiate the child class object elsewhere in your extension.
 * 
 * **In extensions on SuiteCommerce 2020.2 and later, use SCView instead of Backbone.View.**
 * 
 * The following example shows how you might extend SCView to create a basic child class object called 'MyView'. As with all views in a SuiteCommerce extension, we define the view with the AMD syntax. Within the factory function of `define()`, we use a constructor function to create the child class object of SCView. Then we immediately call the parent class (SCView) with the `call()` method. 
 * 
 * After creating the constructor function, we need to use the MyView `prototype` property to inherit methods from its parent, SCView. To copy SCView's properties and methods to MyView, use `Object.create()` to create an object instance of SCView.prototype. At this stage, however, the MyView constructor points to SCView, so we need to restore MyView's constructor with `MyView.prototype.constructor = MyView`. 
 * 
 * The remainder of the example is concerned with setting context data for the template - with `getContext()` - and validating requested context data - with `validateContextDataRequest()`. In this case, when we validate the requested context data, we return `true` to take into account any data that is optional.
 * 
 *  _MyView.View.js_
 * ```javascript
 * 			define(
 * 	'MyView', 
 * 	['SCView', 'my_view.tpl'],
 * 	function('SCViewComponent', my_view_tpl) {
 * 		'use strict';
 * 
 * 		var SCView = SCViewComponent.SCView;
 * 
 * 		function MyView(options) {
 * 			SCView.call(this);
 * 
 * 			this.options = options || {};
 * 
 * 			this.template = my_view_tpl;
 * 
 * 			this.attributes = { id: 'MyViewId', class: 'my-view' };
 * 
 * 			this.contextDataRequest = ['miscData'];
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		// Inherit parent instance methods.
 * 		MyView.prototype = Object.create(SCView.prototype);
 * 
 * 		// Restore the constuctor.
 * 		MyView.prototype.constructor = MyView;
 * 
 * 		MyView.prototype.getContext = function() {
 * 			var miscData = this.contextData.miscData && this.contextData.miscData();
 * 
 * 			return {
 * 				name: this.options.name || "Name",
 * 				data: miscData ? miscData.data : 'Miscellaneous Data';
 * 			} 
 * 		}
 * 				
 * 		MyView.prototype.validateContextDataRequest = function() {
 * 			return true;
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		MyView.prototype.contextDataRequest = ['miscData'];
 * 		
 * 		// Return the AMD constructor.
 * 		return MyView;
 * 	}
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * Our example view references a single template file to display content. The object returned by `getContext()` contains two properties, `name` and `data`, which hold data for the template. Handlebars placeholders in the template display the data.
 * 
 *  _my_view.tpl_
 * ```html
 * 			<div>
 * 	<h3>{{name}}</h3>
 * 	<hr />
 * 	<h6>{{data}}</h6>
 * </div>
 * ```
 * &nbsp;
 * **Note**: The SCView class contains a number of private methods and properties (listed below) that you should not override or use (do not get or set the values of private properties).
