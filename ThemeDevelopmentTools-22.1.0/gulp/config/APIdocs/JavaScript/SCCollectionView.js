/**
 * SCCollectionView is an abstract class that lets you display a collection (list) of items, usually in a grid pattern. Use this class when you want to display a list of elements on the page. It takes an array (of elements) as its only parameter.
 * 
 * To use SCCollectionView, create a component that inherits from the SCCollectionView class. In the child class object, call the parent class constructor with call() or apply(). SCCollectionView takes an array of elements as its only parameter. You will need to pass in the elements to your child class object.
 * 
 * Note that the {@link SCCollectionView#getCellViewInstance|getCellViewInstance()} method, which returns an instance of a cell view, is called once for each element in the array passed to the SCCollection constructor.
 * 
 * The following example shows how to use SCCollectionView. Since SCCollectionView is an abstract class, we must override it with a child class. SCCollectionView has an abstract property, `template`, and an abstract method `getCellViewInstance`, both of which must be overridden.
 * 
 * _FacetsItemsCollectionView.View.js_
 * ```javascript
 * 			define(
 * 	'FacetsItemsCollectionView.View',
 * 	[
 * 		'Backbone',
 * 		'SCCollectionView',
 * 		'Facets.ItemCell.View',
 * 		'RowView',
 * 		'facets_items_collection.tpl',
 * 		'facets_items_collection_view_row.tpl'
 * 	]
 * 	function(Backbone, SCCollectionView_, FacetsItemCellView, RowView, facets_items_collection_tpl, facets_items_collection_view_row_tpl) {
 * 		'use strict';
 * 
 * 		var SCCollectionView = SCCollectionView_.SCCollectionView;
 * 
 * 		function FacetsItemsCollectionView() {
 * 			var collection = ['Hats', 'Scarves', 'Gloves'];
 * 			SCCollectionView.call(this, collection);
 * 		
 * 			this.template = facets_items_collection_tpl;
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	FacetsItemsCollectionView.prototype = Object.create(SCCollectionView.prototype);
 * 
 * 	FacetsItemsCollectionView.prototype.constructor = FacetsItemsCollectionView;
 * 
 * 	FacetsItemsCollectionView.prototype.getContext = function() {
 * 		return {};
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	FacetsItemsCollectionView.prototype.getCellViewsPerRow = function() {
 * 		return 2; //The number of cells to be rendered in a row.
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	FacetsItemsCollectionView.prototype.getCellViewInstance = function(
 * 		element,
 * 		index
 * 	) {
 * 		return new FacetsItemCellView({
 * 			element: element,
 * 			index: index
 * 		});
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	FacetsItemsCollectionView.prototype.getRowViewInstance = function(index) {
 * 		return new RowView({ template: facets_items_collection_view_row_tpl });
 * 	}
 * );
 * ```
 * &nbsp;<br>
 * 
 * When using SCCollectionView, at a minimum, you must override the {@link SCCollectionView#getCellViewInstance|getCellViewInstance()} method and return a instance of an {@link SCView} view.
 * 
 * To render the elements of the collection, you must provide two template files with specific placeholders. The first template file is required by your child class object to display the row container. It must contain a HTML element with the following data attribute: `data-type="backbone.collection.view.rows"`.
 * 
 * _facets_items_collection.tpl_
 * ```html
 * 			<div data-type="backbone.collection.view.rows"></div>
 * ```
 * &nbsp;<br>
 *  
 * The second template file is required by the view instance to display a row. It must contain a HTML element with the following data attribute: `data-type="backbone.collection.view.cells"`.
 * 
 * _facets_items_collection_view_row.tpl_
 * ```html
 * 			<div class="facets-items-collection-view-row">
 * 	<div data-type="backbone.collection.view.cells"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 * &nbsp;<br>
 *  
 * **Note**: The SCCollectionView class contains a number of private methods and properties (listed below) that you should not override or use. For example, do not get or set the values of private properties.
 * 
 *  
 * @abstract
 * @extends View
 * @since SuiteCommerce 2020.2
